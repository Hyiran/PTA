# FORMATTING: SCRIPT|THREADS|DURATION|RUNS
# SCRIPT:
# THREADS: The number of worker threads each worker process should start.
# DURATION: The maximum length of time in seconds that each worker process should run for. 
# RUNS: The number of runs each worker process will perform. This is usually set to 0, meaning "will run forever".
# TIPS: DURATION can be specified in conjunction with RUNS, in which case the worker processes will terminate if either the DURATION time or the number of RUNS is exceeded.
